Tune the oscillator with param A and use the left audio input for 1v/oct CV control. Pitch can also be set with MIDI Note On messages. Use the right audio input for CV control over the level of frequency-sync'd FM. Param B morphs between the three Knot equations. Params C and D set the P and Q coefficients. Buttons A and B will mute the overtones introduced by P and Q. An additional tone can be added by increasing S Volume with param AA (CC75). Param AB (CC76) controls FM Amount for S. Params AC (CC77), AD (CC78) and AE (CC79) "detune" P, Q, and S. Rotation speed around the X, Y, and Z axes is proportional to P, Q, and S. Output param F is the sine of the X rotation and output param G is the cosine of the Y rotation. Gate Out goes high for 10ms every time the Knot completes a rotation around any axis. Set rotation with params AF (CC80), AG (CC81), and AH (CC82). Return a param to zero to resume automatic rotation. Perlin noise can be added to the 3D points with param BA (CC83) for a distortion-like effect.
